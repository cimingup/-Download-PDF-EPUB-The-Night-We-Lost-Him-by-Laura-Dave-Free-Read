SYNOPSIS : 

Estranged siblings discover their father has been keeping a secret for over fifty years, one that may have been fatal...Liam Noone was many things to many people. To the public, he was an exacting, self-made hotel magnate fleeing his past. To his three ex-wives, he was a loving albeit distant family man who kept his finances flush and his families carefully separated. To Nora, he was a father who?often?loved her from afar ? notably a cliffside cottage perched on the California coast from which he fell to his death.? ?The authorities rule the death accidental, but Nora and her estranged brother Sam have other ideas. As Nora and Sam form an uneasy alliance to unravel the mystery, they start putting together the pieces of their father?s past?and uncover a family secret that changes everything.With Laura Dave?s trademark combination of soulful suspense and evocative family drama, The Night We Lost Him?is a riveting page-turner with a heartbreaking final twist you?ll never see coming.
